Networked Notes gives us a minimal note-taking system accompanied by an editable graph to help the users organize their thoughts into a bigger structure.

It contains significant code from HTML5 Demos, Lunr's example site, and RKirsling's DAG Editor, and is based off Dafna Shahaf's Metromaps papers and a subsequent project by Edward Yang, Russell Chou and Jacob Jensen. Thanks to all those folks.
