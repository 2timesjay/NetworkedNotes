The brothers' father is currently living in the semi-autonomous Russian province of Dagestan, which is adjacent to Chechnya.\n The entire region has been roiled by ethnic tensions, Islamic militants and corruption.\n The history of Chechens may -- or may not -- shed light on the men's lives in America or their motivation for the bombings.\n Watch Live Coverage of the Manhunt for the Boston Marathon Bombers on ABC News\n  Read ABC News' full coverage of the Boston Marathon Bombers Manhunt\n Who are the Chechens?\n Chechens are an ethnic group hailing from the southern edge of the Russian border, known as the North Caucasus region, whose history has been marked by its violent struggles for independence.\n After the fall of the Soviet Union, Chechens launched two significant campaigns for independence, leading to the First Chechen War in 1994 (a year after the younger suspect was born) and the Second Chechen War in 1999, which has led to ongoing violence in the region.\n Brothers Suspected in Boston Bombings Watch Video\n Authorities Investigate Bombing Suspects' Global Connections Watch Video\n Marathon Bombing Suspects' Uncle: 'We Are Ashamed' Watch Video\n Could this attack have something to do with those wars?\n Maybe, according to Christopher Swift, a professor of National Security at Georgetown University, who said the second Chechen war has morphed into a \"radical\" and \"virulent\" war that has incorporated elements of the Muslim idea of jihad.\n \"That war initially began as a nationalist war, much like the first one, but very, very quickly metastasized into something that looks much more like the radical Salafi-Jihadi movements we've seen in other regions around the world,\" Swift said.\n \"The movement that's emerged from the 15 years of war is very radical, it's very virulent, it's very nasty, but up until now, it's also been very, very local. Their ideology and rhetoric talks about fighting jihad against the West, but their operations have always been in Russia itself and predominately within the republics of Chechnya, Dagestan, and Ingushetia,\" he said.\n \"So the bombing in Boston at the Boston Marathon, doesn't really seem to comport with the operations we've seen from of this region in the past, but it does comport with the self-radicalizing ideology,\" he said.\n What connection do Chechens have to Islam?\n The majority of Chechens are Muslims, and the Council on Foreign Relations say that there are several ties between Chechen militants and Al Qaeda, noting that the U.S. has publicly said that Osama bin Laden had \"fueled the flames in Chechnya.\"\n The State Department has identified Al Qaeda financiers who also finance Chechen rebels, according to the CFR. The most prominent of these groups is the Islamic International Peacekeeping Brigade.\n A terror group in Chechnya has also identified itself with Muslim extremists, calling itself the Special Purpose Islamic Regiment, recognized by the U.S. State Department as a terrorist group.\n The Central Asia-Caucasus Institute has said that ideas of jihad and an Islamic state spread among Chechen people as they fanned out across the Middle East following the Second Chechen War.\nHave Chechen groups launched terror attacks before?\n The Chechens have claimed responsibility for a number of major terror attacks on Russia in the past 10 years, including a 2004 attack on a Russian school in which more than 350 people, many of them children, were killed.\n In addition to bombing shopping plazas, apartment buildings, parades, and trains over the years, Chechens launched an attack on a theater in Moscow in 2002 in which they held more than 700 audience members hostage. Russian forces used gas to try and sedate the Chechens, but ended up killing many of the hostages and militants.\nFederal Bureau of Investigation/AP\nThis Federal Bureau of Investigation shows a...

Though Dagestan did not fight against Russia for independence after the fall of the Soviet Union, it became known as a lawless and corrupt state. Eventually, Chechen militants began to gain a foothold in Dagestan.\n Dagestan has replaced Chechnya as the most volatile region in Russia, with reports of bombings, shootings, and kidnappings occurring every few days.", "date": "Fri, 19 Apr 2013 00:00:00 GMT", "id": "3371"}, {"title": "Boston Marathon Explosions: Thursday's Developments : NPR", "url": "http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/04/18/177726815/boston-marathon-explosions-thursdays-developments", "author": "-", "content": "Throughout the day, we'll be updating with the latest news about the two explosions Monday near the finish line of the Boston Marathon.

Where Things Stand.\nINVESTIGATION: The FBI released images of two men who they say are suspects in the bombing of the Boston Marathon that left three people dead and injured about 180.\nFBI Special Agent in Charge Richard DesLauriers said the FBI identified one individual at first, but after reviewing video and other evidence they determined that another individual was also implicated.\nDesLauriers said one video shows a man wearing a white baseball cap dropping off a bag in front of the restaurant, which was the site of the second explosion. The FBI released images and video of the men and they are asking for the public's help identifying them.\nThe images they released appear to come from surveillance cameras along the marathon route. They show two young men wearing baseball caps. Both of them appear to be wearing hoodies underneath black winter coats. Both of them are also carrying backpacks. In the video, the man wearing a white cap is seen walking closely behind the man wearing a black cap.\nDeLauriers did not release any other details of the investigation, because he said identifying and capturing the suspects is \"our highest priority.\"\nAt the website of the FBI's Boston bureau, officials have posted this appeal for help: \"If you have any information that could be of assistance, please call 1-800-CALL-FBI (prompt #3). No detail is too small.\"\nHe said no member of the public should try to apprehend the suspects because they are assumed to be \"armed and extremely dangerous.\"\nEMERGENCY DECLARATION: \"President Obama has signed an emergency declaration for the state of Massachusetts \u2014 a move that frees up federal funding to help with crisis management,\" WBUR writes.\nINTERFAITH SERVICE: At service Thursday morning in Boston's Cathedral of the Holy Cross, leaders from a cross-section of faiths spoke about the horror of the bombings \u2014 and the heroism and selflessness of those who rushed to help. President Obama, who assured the people of Boston that the nation stands with them and said to those responsible for the attack that \"we will find you,\" was there with first lady Michelle Obama. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee and a former governor of Massachusetts, is in attendance. We've put a copy of the program for the service below.\nUpdate at 7:02 p.m. ET. The Significance Of Suspect:\nNPR's Tom Gjelten tells our Newscast unit that what struck him about the press conference is that the FBI is now calling these two men \"suspects.\"\nEven Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano called them people of interest during her testimony earlier today.\nThis change in terminology, said Tom, means the \"FBI now suspect the men of being responsible for this bombing at the Boston Marathon.\"\nTom also points out that the men ended up at the two bomb sites separately, but earlier they were seen walking close to each other.\nUpdate at 5:33 p.m. ET. Images:\nWe've added one of the images released by the FBI at the top of this post. The agency has posted 10 others on its website.\nThe FBI is asking the public to call 1-800-CALL-FBI, if they have any information about the suspects.\n\"Somebody out there knows these individuals as friends, neighbors, co-workers or family members of the suspects. Though it may be difficult, the nation is counting on those with information to come forward and provide it to us,\" DesLauriers said. He also added that no one should try to apprehend them, because they are presumed to be \"armed and extremely dangerous.\"\nUpdate at 5:28 p.m. ET. One Suspect Seen Dropping Off Bag:\nDeLauriers said that only one of the suspects is seen dropping off a bag near the scene of the explosion.\nDeLauriers did not release any other details of the investigation, because he said identifying and capturing the suspects is \"our highest priority.\"\nUpdate at 5:26 p.m. ET. Video:\nHere is one of the videos released by the FBI:\n YouTube\nUpdate at 5:23 p.m. ET. The Public's Help:\n\"We know the public will play a critical role in identifying the individuals,\" DeLauriers said. But he warned that people should not try to apprehend them, because they are \"armed and extremely dangerous.\"\nUpdate at 5:20 p.m. ET. Two Suspects:\nFBI Special Agent in Charge Richard DesLauriers says the FBI has identified two suspects. DesLauriers is showing images of two men. One of them is wearing a black hat the other is wearing a white hat.\nUpdate at 4:59 p.m. ET. Awaiting Press Conference:\nAn FBI news conference is scheduled to begin at any minute now. NPR will carry it live. We're expecting the FBI to release photographs of two men they are interested in speaking to.\nWe'll post those pictures as soon as we get them.\nUpdate at 4:25 p.m. ET. FBI Will Release Photos:\nAn official familiar with the investigation tells NPR that the FBI is interested in speaking to two men seen in photos or videos of the scene near the finish line at the race.\nAccording to the official, the FBI will release photos of the men during the press conference.\nBoth men are described as being in their 20s. Like Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, the FBI has not described them as suspects.\nUpdate at 4:03 p.m. ET. Number Of Critically Injured Down To 7:\nThe AP has some good news:\n\"Boston hospitals reported seven people in critical condition on Thursday, down from 14 on Wednesday.\"\nAccording to CNN's count, about 60 people remained hospitalized.\nUpdate at 3:46 p.m. ET. The Decision To Amputate:\nNo doubt one of the threads that we will follow for a long time to come will be the recovery of the bombing victims. As we've reported, many of them lost limbs in the attack.\nWBUR spoke to Tracey Dechert, a trauma surgeon at Boston Medical Center, about the gut-wrenching decision to amputate.\nShe explained that in a lot of ways making the decision quickly can be better in the long run. It's still doesn't make the decision any easier.\n\"Of course you would want everyone to have all their limbs,\" Dechert told WBUR. \"And even though you know down the road this is the best thing for them given the situation, it's still very sad, obviously, though.\"\nOn the same thread, The New York Times has a piece about how sports and war have inspired better design in prosthetics. The paper reports that 1,600 Americans lost limbs during the war in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\"Now, the vast body of knowledge gained from treating those troops is likely to help speed and improve the recovery of people whose limbs were amputated after Monday's attack,\" the Times reports.\nUpdate at 3:06 p.m. ET. News Conference Scheduled:\nThe FBI has scheduled a news briefing for 5 p.m. in Boston. Of course, this is bound to change. If you remember, yesterday, the FBI scheduled press conferences but eventually called them off.\nUpdate at 12:25 p.m. ET \"We Will Find You\" And You Won't Beat Us:\n\"We will find you and yes, you will face justice,\" the president promises the person or persons responsible for the bombings. \"Small, stunted individuals who would destroy instead of build and somehow think that makes them more important\" don't understand that \"a bomb can't beat us,\" Obama adds.\n\"We will keep going ... we will finish the race,\" he also says, just like 78-year-old Bill Iffrig, the runner who the world saw get knocked over by one of the bomb blasts. Iffrig picked himself up and finished the last few yards of the marathon. \"We may be momentarily knocked off our feet, Obama says, \"but we will pick ourselves up.\" After his address, those in attendance sang \"America the Beautiful\" and the service came to a close.\nUpdate at 12:15 p.m. ET. \"They Picked The Wrong City\":\nThe president gets a standing ovation when he says that if \"whomever committed this heinous act\" thought they could intimidate or terrorize anyone, \"they picked the wrong city to do it!\"\nBoston, Obama says, will \"stand and walk and yes, run again ... of that I have no doubt.. ... You will run again because that's what the people of Boston are made of. Your resolve is the greatest rebuke to whomever committed this heinous act.\"\nUpdate at 12:07 p.m. ET. \"Every One Of Us Stands With You,\" Obama Says:\nThe president begins his remarks at the interfaith service by speaking of the beautiful day in Boston that in an instant, \"was shattered.\"\n\"A celebration became a tragedy,\" Obama says. His message, the president continues, is that \"every one of us has been touched by this attack on your beloved city. Every one of us stands with you.\"\nUpdate at 12:02 p.m. ET. Having Faith When Things Don't Make Sense:\nHis faith, says Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, teaches that \"in everything, give thanks. That isn't always easy to do.\" But after Monday's \"cowardice,\" he found reasons to give thanks \u2014 for the first responders, the volunteers, the medical professionals, the police and most of all, the people of Boston who \"let their first instinct be kindness.\"\n\"The grace this tragedy exposed is the best of who we are,\" Patrick added just before introducing President Obama.\nUpdate at 11:50 a.m. ET. Goodness In The Face Of Evil:\nMonday's \"act of senseless violence\" is a reminder of the \"darkness that can lurk in the human heart,\" says Cardinal Sean O'Malley, head of the Roman Catholic Church in Boston. But the way so many reacted is a reminder that \"there resides in people's hearts a goodness that is incredibly selfless,\" he says. The cardinal is to be followed at the interfaith service by a performance from cellist Yo-Yo Ma.\nUpdate at 11:42 a.m. ET. \"Blessed Are The Peacemakers\":\nThe Gospel reading is from Matthew 5:1-12, and is read by Bishop John M. Borders III of Morning Star Baptist Church in Mattapan, Mass.\nUpdate at 11:38 a.m. ET. \"Up To The Mountain.\"\nA very emotional moment at the interfaith service: As the Boston Children's Chorus sings Patty Griffin's \"Up to the Mountain,\" tears flow down the cheeks of one young singer's cheeks.\nUpdate at 11:34 a.m. ET. \"Joy Comes In The Morning\":\nThe interfaith service continues. Even as God \"allows hatred and fanaticism to have its moment, says Rev. Roberto Miranda of Congregaci\u00f3n Le\u00f3n de Jud\u00e1 in Roxbury, Mass., \"in the end, goodness will always prevail. ... Weeping may stay for the night, but joy comes in the morning.\" Reminder: We've posted the program for the interfaith service below.\nUpdate at 11:30 a.m. ET. \"We All Have Service To Perform\":\nNasser S. Wedaddy, chair of the New England Interfaith Council and civil rights outreach director at the American Islamic Congress, also praises those \"who stepped forward\" and says \"we all have service to perform. ... To heal, to rebuild and to serve once again as a shining city on the hill.\"\nUpdate at 11:24 a.m. ET. A Mention Of The Tragedy In Texas:\nRabbi Ronne Friedman of Boston's Temple Israel includes a mention of those killed and injured Wednesday night in West, Texas, where a fertilizer plant exploded. \"Our arms are wide enough to hold you as well,\" he says.\nUpdate at 11:22 a.m. ET. \"May You Run And Not Grow Weary\":\nAt the interfaith service, Rev. Nancy Taylor of Old South Church tells how her place of worship holds a service for Boston marathoners each year. The church sends the runners off with these words from the Prophet Isaiah: \"May you run and not grow weary, may you walk and not grow faint.\" On Monday, she says, she saw marathoners running \"toward the danger\" and sacrificing themselves for others.\nUpdate at 11:14 a.m. ET. Mayor Menino Has Never Loved Boston More Than Now:\nHis voice choking, Mayor Thomas Menino (D) says that after the bombings, \"love has covered this resilient city. I have never loved it and its people more than I do today.\" He praises \"the brave ones who felt the blast and still raced to the smoke.\" The love and the bravery gives those in Boston, the victims and their families the strength to carry on, he says. \"We triumphed over that hateful act,\" Menino adds. Reminder: We've posted the program for the interfaith service below.\nUpdate at 11:08 a.m. ET. Thanks For Those Who Helped The Victims:\nAfter praying for the victims, Eminence Methodios, head of the Greek Orthodox Church in Boston, thanks God \"for the police and firefighters, the National Guard, for the doctors and nurses, for all who responded selflessly and courageously.\"\nUpdate at 11:05 a.m. ET. \"We Will Rise\":\n\"Through the blur of each other's tears, we will rise in one community ... resolutely, as one,\" says Rev. Liz Walker of Roxbury Presbyterian Church, as she opens the interfaith service.\nUpdate at 10:55 a.m. ET. Interfaith Service Is About To Start:\nThe president and first lady Michelle Obama just took their seats in Boston's Cathedral of the Holy Cross. WhiteHouse.gov is among the websites streaming coverage of the service.\nUpdate at 10:45 a.m. ET. FBI Wants To Speak With Two Men, Napolitano Confirms:\n\"Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano says the FBI wants to speak with two men seen in at least one video from the Boston Marathon, but she says she isn't calling them suspects,\" The Associated Press reports.\nThe wire service adds that \"without providing details of the men's appearance or what the video shows, Napolitano told the House Homeland Security Committee on Thursday that 'there is some video that raised the question' of two men the FBI would like to interview but said she wouldn't described them as suspects. Napolitano said it's still unclear whether the bombs that exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon were the work of foreign or domestic terrorists. She said the investigation is continuing 'apace.' \"\nUpdate at 10:25 a.m. ET. President To Meet With Victims, First Responders:\nReporters traveling with the president, including NPR's Ari Shapiro, report he plans to spend some time today meeting with people who were injured in the bombings and with the first responders who rushed to help the victims.\nUpdate at 10:10 a.m. ET. People Lined Up Hours Ahead Of Service, And A Look At The Program:\nThere were people in line as early as 5 a.m. ET for the interfaith service, WBUR reports.\nThe program for this morning's service shows it will begin with the hymn \"Praise to the Lord, the Almighty,\" that the Boston Children's Chorus will sing Patty Griffin's \"Up to the Mountain\" and that there will be \"reflections\" from both Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and President Obama.\nUpdate at 9:10 a.m. ET. Images Of Two Individuals May Soon Be Released:\n\"Authorities have clear video images of two separate suspects in the Boston Marathon bombings carrying black bags at each explosion site and are planning to release the images today in an appeal for the public's help in identifying the men,\" The Boston Globe reports.

He was 96.\n Jin's death on Saturday leaves one of China's largest and wealthiest dioceses in a deeply unsettled state, underscoring continuing tensions generated by the ruling Communist Party's insistence on tightly controlling all organized religions.\n Jin's first anointed successor as acting bishop, Joseph Xing Wenzhi, resigned last year for reasons still unclear, and his replacement, Thaddeus Ma Daqin, was placed under house arrest at Shanghai's Sheshan Seminary after enraging party officials by renouncing his membership in the party-controlled Catholic Patriotic Association.\n Born into a Catholic family in Shanghai in June 1916, Jin was ordained as a Jesuit priest in 1938 and spent several years studying in France, Germany, and other European nations. Returning to his native Shanghai in 1951, Jin was imprisoned for nearly two decades under Communist China's founder, Mao Zedong, who ordered Chinese Catholics to cut their ties with the Vatican and jailed hundreds of priests and nuns as counter-revolutionaries.\n Jin was paroled in 1972 and put to work as a translator based on his knowledge of several European languages. Following Mao's death in 1976, he was formally released and named Shanghai bishop in 1988 by the Patriotic Association. Although the Vatican recognized another priest as Shanghai bishop, Jin worked tirelessly to recover church property and rebuild congregations, achieving a remarkable degree of independence from the authorities in Beijing.\n China has an estimated 8 million to 12 million Catholics, around half of whom worship in congregations outside the control of the Patriotic Association.\n Jin served on the official advisory body to China's rubber-stamp parliament as well as the Patriotic Association, making him a frequent target of critics who argued he was too cooperative with the authorities.\n He acknowledged those complaints in a 2005 interview with The Associated Press, saying he hoped the appointment of his successor would heal the rift between the official church and the semi-clandestine one that defies party control. The two disagree most sharply over the appointment of bishops, and it remains unclear whether the Vatican and Beijing will be able to forge a consensus on a new Shanghai bishop.\n \"Bishop Jin Luxian loved the country and the church all his life,\" the official Catholic association said in a statement on its website. \"His death is not only a great loss for the Shanghai diocese, but for the entire Catholic church in China.\"\n In a statement, U.S. Ambassador to China Gary Locke said Jin had \"worked diligently to promote understanding between Chinese Catholics of all persuasions and provided a beacon of hope for reconciliation between China and the Holy See.\"\n \"We hope that his legacy of devotion to both his faith and his countrymen will long provide a model for others to follow,\" Locke said.", "date": "Mon, 29 Apr 2013 00:00:00 GMT", "id": "6081"}, {"title": "Explosions at the Finish Line: Two Eyewitness Accounts of Boston\u2019s Marathon Attack", "url": "http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/04/15/boston-marathon-eyewitness/", "author": "-", "content": "TheLogician\nThat might have been North Korea's nuke strike.

The threshold event was the premiere in a Paris theater, on May 29, 1913, of Igor Stravinsky\u2019s ballet \u201cThe Rite of Spring.\u201d Discordant music, wholly unconventional choreography, and narrative incoherence led to a near-riot in the audience, and a sensational argument among critics. That the instigators of this outrage were Russian artists politicized the aesthetic revolt: \u201cWe were all revolutionists,\u201d said Stravinsky\u2019s collaborator Sergei Diaghilev. And what revolutions followed!\nIf Stravinsky\u2019s music seemed anarchic, so did his theme \u2014 old men in whose approving presence the young are destroyed. The ballet\u2019s segments moved from \u201cthe ritual of the rival tribes\u201d to \u201cthe great sacrifice,\u201d during which the chosen maiden thrills the elders by dancing herself to death. That Stravinsky\u2019s original title for the piece was \u201cThe Victim\u201d soon resonated with the experience of a generation.\nOnly in hindsight does \u201cThe Rite of Spring\u201d emerge as a cultural marker, a kind of forecast of the moral anarchy of World War I. That connection informs the title of historian Modris Ekstein\u2019s 1989 book, \u201cRites of Spring: The Great War and the Birth of the Modern Age.\u201d The sinking of the Titanic took on retrospective symbolism once Europe had suicidally wrecked itself at the Western Front, and so did Stravinsky\u2019s prophetic assault on convention. The old men of Europe sacrificed the continent\u2019s young, who, like the maiden, willingly gave themselves to death.\nFrom the vantage of a full century later, when that tragic epoch is regularly evoked through a nostalgic haze in blockbusters like \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d and the latest movie version of \u201cThe Great Gatsby,\u201d both \u201cThe Rite of Spring\u201d and World War I can be seen as flags of a moral transformation that is still unfolding today.\nGatsby, as Brooks Brothers reminds us, is a timeless American type, even if his story is set in 1922. Gatsby\u2019s nihilism reeks of the trenches. Those who survived the Western Front became the Lost Generation, and the loss remains. They \u201ctold us the war was over,\u201d one veteran wrote. \u201cThat was a laugh. We ourselves are the war.\u201d From Verdun to Warsaw to Hiroshima to Bach Mai to Sarajevo to Chechnya to Baghdad to Damascus \u2014 we human beings have ourselves become the war. How?\nStravinsky\u2019s work generated an effervescence of dispute which was thrilling to those caught up in it. The start of the Great War did something similar, at least at first; a cry resounded in the streets of Europe, \u201cIt\u2019s on!\u201d For Germany, the war promised purification of decadence. France foresaw \u201cLa Grande Manifestation\u201d of national glory. Britain aimed, in a phrase coined by H.G. Wells, at the war to end all wars. For the United States, it would be, in Wilson\u2019s slogan, the war to make the world safe for democracy.\nEach projection was millennial, with the destruction, no matter how total, expected to usher in a kind of secular salvation. That subliminal mysticism, foreseen by Stravinsky, locked itself on the human imagination. For the 100 years since \u2014 in death camps, bombed cities, torched villages, blown-up cafes, booby-trapped roadsides, airliners-turned-missiles, and the sights of unmanned drones \u2014 the apocalyptic principle of salvation through destruction has ruled, and still threatens us today.\n\u201cThe world broke in two in 1922 or thereabouts,\u201d as Willa Cather put it. Fascism, Nazism, and Stalinism all emerged from that break. At great cost, they were defeated. But the crack in the world remained, and humans kept trying to fill it with the corpses of enemies. Stravinsky\u2019s \u201cRite of Spring\u201d regeneration depended on violence, as if there were no life but through death. The primacy of death was Stravinsky\u2019s outrageous idea, which he offered as a warning. Yet it played out quite literally among \u201crival tribes\u201d on the century\u2019s battlefields.\nWith lessons learned, the next 100 years can be different. Wars rage today, yes. But they outrage, too. Our species is suddenly capable of truly global communication and transnational economic cooperation. Borders mean nothing to the Web. Our planet has itself become the universal village \u2014 which means no more saving the village by destroying it. Millennial illusions, on which total war depends, are unsustainable. The world that broke in two can be one again, the lost generations found.\nJames Carroll writes regularly for the Globe.", "date": "Mon, 27 May 2013 00:00:00 GMT", "id": "9667"}, {"title": "Boston police commissioner 'fine' with death for bombing suspect", "url": "http://now.msn.com/edward-davis-boston-police-commissioner-fine-with-death-penalty-for-dzhokhar-tsarnaev", "author": "-", "content": "photos\nviral videos\nanimals\nfunny\ncollege\ngood\nweird\nDASHBOARD\nBoston Police Commissioner Edward Davis has no problem with Boston terror suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev getting the death penalty. \"That's fine with me\" was the sentiment from the man whose job it was to hunt down the bombers.

So I could see how it would be difficult to talk about it.\nBut Tamerlan Tsarnvaev died early Friday. This was Sunday night. At some point, mourning ends and suspicion begins.\nHaving said that, I could see why any Muslim might be concerned about speaking to the FBI, let alone one whose husband may be a huge terrorist.

So why won\u2019t she talk to the FBI, especially when there\u2019s understandable concern as to whether Tamerlan and his brother, Dzhokhar, were planning any other attacks, and it might be nice to know if those attacks are still moving ahead (did they have any accomplices, and where they working on behalf of someone else?)

Shattered bones, shredded tissue, nails burrowed deep beneath the flesh. The decision had to be made, over and over, with little time to deliberate. Should this leg be amputated? What about this one?\n\u201cAs an orthopedic surgeon, we see patients like this, with mangled extremities, but we don\u2019t see 16 of them at the same time, and we don\u2019t see patients from blast injuries,\u201d Dr. Peter Burke, the trauma surgery chief at Boston Medical Center, said.\nThe toll from the bombs Monday at the Boston Marathon, which killed at least three and injured more than 170, will long be felt by anyone involved with the city\u2019s iconic sporting event. For the victims, the physical legacy could be an especially cruel one for a group that was involved in the marathon: severe leg trauma and amputations.\n\u201cWhat we like to do is before we take off someone\u2019s leg \u2014 it\u2019s extremely hard to make that decision \u2014 is we often get two surgeons to agree,\u201d Dr. Tracey Dechert, a trauma surgeon at Boston Medical, said. \u201cAm I right here? This can\u2019t be saved. So that way you feel better and know that you didn\u2019t take off someone\u2019s leg that you didn\u2019t have to take. All rooms had multiple surgeons so everyone could feel like we\u2019re doing what we need to be doing.\u201d\nThe widespread leg trauma was a result of bombs that seemed to deliver their most vicious blows within two feet of the ground. In an instant, doctors at hospitals throughout the city who had been preparing for ordinary marathon troubles \u2014 dehydration or hypothermia \u2014 now faced profound, life-changing decisions for runners and spectators of all ages.\nSome victims arrived two to an ambulance, some with huge holes in their legs where skin and fat and muscle were ripped away by the bomb and with ball bearings or nails from the bombs embedded in their flesh. Others had severed arteries in their legs or multiple breaks in the bones of their legs and feet. The shock wave from the blast destroyed blood vessels, skin, muscle and fat. And at least nine patients \u2014 five at Boston Medical Center, three at Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital and one at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital \u2014 had legs or feet so mangled they would need to be amputated.\nSome of the attendant medical professionals, said Julie Dunbar, a chaplain at Beth Israel, were faced with \u201cmore trauma than most ever see in a lifetime, more sadness, more loss.\u201d\nThere were only three fatalities, which doctors say was because the blast, low to the ground, mostly injured people\u2019s legs and feet instead of their abdomens, chests or heads. And tourniquets stopped what could have been fatal bleeding in many.\nDr. Allan Panter, 57, an emergency-room physician from Gainesville, Ga., was standing 10 yards from the blast near the finish line, waiting for his wife, Theresa, to complete her 16th Boston Marathon. Assisted by others, he said he used gauze wraps to apply tourniquets to several victims, including a man who appeared to be in his late 20s who lost both of his lower legs in the blast. He said he saw another six or seven victims with belts tied around their wounded legs.\nTourniquets, once discouraged because they were thought to cause damage to injuries, have returned to favor and have been used to treat wounds inflicted by explosive devices in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Dr. Panter said.\n\u201cWith blast injuries to the lower extremities that we\u2019re getting in the Middle East, you bleed out,\u201d he said. Tourniquets \u201ccan help save lives. I don\u2019t know if they helped in this situation, but it sure couldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d\nWhile there was some initial chaos in a medical tent near the finish line, and some screaming and moaning by victims, it was generally an orderly scene, Dr. Panter said. He assisted others in wheeling in a female victim who died, he said. He described 20 to 30 cots in the tent with IV bags that had been intended for dehydrated runners.\nAt least eight doctors and what seemed to be 20 or more nurses were stationed in the tent. A man with a microphone stood in the center of the tent to coordinate medical care. Arriving victims were assessed and categorized as 1 for critical, 2 for intermediate, 3 for \u201ccan wait\u201d and \u201cblack tag\u201d for anyone who appeared to be dead, Dr. Panter said. An emergency medical technician outside the tent coordinated ambulance service to hospitals.\n\u201cAll in all, it was a pretty controlled environment,\u201d said Dr. Panter, who has been an emergency-room physician for 30 years. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot worse. They were without question ready \u2014 not ready for those type of injuries, but they were prepared.\u201d\nOnce victims were transported to Boston\u2019s hospitals, doctors had to carefully coordinate their response. Each has a story of where they were when the bombs went off and how they rushed to help and how, in some cases, they somehow just missed being victims themselves.\nDr. Alok Gupta, who directed the surgical response at Beth Israel, said he often goes to the finish line of the marathon to watch the race. But this year he was so tired that he took a nap. Then he heard ambulance sirens and helicopters outside his home in Back Bay, near the marathon finish. He was just beginning to wonder why the sirens had not dissipated and why the helicopters were hovering when his cellphone rang.\n\u201cThe call was broken up,\u201d he said. \u201cAll I heard was \u2018mass casualty.\u2019\u00a0\u201d And \u201cwe need you,\u201d he said.\nHe was out of the house in less than a minute and at the hospital five minutes later. Then he and his colleagues set to work. They cleared the emergency room, sending home those who could leave and sending others to beds elsewhere in the building. They cleared intensive care, sending patients to other areas of the hospital. Dr. Gupta directed a central command.\n\u201cSurgeons were notified, emergency-room physicians were notified, operating-room personnel were notified, everyone was notified,\u201d he said. Cellphone service in Boston was limited, so doctors, nurses and other medical professionals were contacted with text messages.\nAbout 10 minutes later, patients began to arrive. Each was put in a room and assessed. Doctors described the situation as calm and efficient.\nSeven patients at Beth Israel went directly to the operating room for emergency surgery to stabilize them, stopping bleeding for example. Five went to intensive care. At Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, six patients went to the operating room and nine to intensive care.\n\u201cI think a lot of these injuries are so devastating, it was pretty straightforward \u2014 they weren\u2019t going to be able to salvage these things,\u201d said Dr. Burke of Boston Medical Center. \u201cWe all would like to salvage whatever extremities we can, but one thing we\u2019ve learned in trauma is when you get too much damage, you can create too much hassle, so you may get the amputation but it may be a year down the line. Ten operations, failed operations, addictions to narcotics for the chronic pains, all these kinds of things.\u201d An early amputation, Dr. Burke added, can mean a quicker return to a normal life.\nBorrowing a tactic used by the military in Iraq, doctors at Beth Israel used felt markers to write patients\u2019 vital signs and injuries on their chests \u2014 safely away from the leg wounds \u2014 so that if a patient\u2019s chart was misplaced during a transfer to surgery or intensive care, for example, there would be no question about what was found in the emergency room.\nThose who needed surgery would often need more than one operation on subsequent days. Those with huge blast wounds that ripped out skin and muscle would need plastic surgery. Those with severed arteries would need surgery, too.\nMost of the injured taken to Beth Israel were no older than 50, said Dr. Michael Yaffe, a trauma surgeon at the hospital. A few were runners, but most were spectators who had prime viewing positions near the finish line.\nAt about 2 a.m. on Tuesday, the Beth Israel medical team left for home, to return again at 6. They examined each patient before they left and again when they returned. Often, in trauma, the doctors said, patients will not notice some of their injuries until the major injury is taken care of.\nThe Boston Marathon is so special, a day to celebrate athleticism and the thrill of the sport. For those runners who trained for months and now can be facing months or years or rehabilitation, and the end of their running days, the bombs took away \u201cthe thing they loved,\u201d Dr. Yaffe said.\nIn the moments after the explosions, some patients recalled that they \u201cthought they would die as they saw the blood spilling out,\u201d said Dr. George Velmahos, chief of trauma services at\u00a0Massachusetts General Hospital. When they awoke Tuesday and realized they were still alive, they said they felt extremely thankful, some even considering themselves lucky, Dr. Velmahos said.\n\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s almost a paradox,\u201d he said, \u201cto see these patients without an extremity to wake up and feel lucky.\u201d", "date": "Published: April 16, 2013", "id": "1043"}, {"title": "Bombing Suspects' Twisted Family Saga", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/International/boston-marathon-bombing-suspects-twisted-family-history/story?id=19012097", "author": "ABC News", "content": "The history of the two Boston bombing suspects' family is a twisted one, woven with the various conflicts that have afflicted their ethnic homeland.\n Sitting at her kitchen table here, the suspects' aunt, Patemat Sulemanova, recounted from memory a complex family history involving a deportation by Soviet leader Josef Stalin, two Chechen wars, and a severe beating in the United States that ultimately brought the suspects' father back to this restive region in southern Russia.\n The suspects moved frequently when they were younger, bouncing between homes as they dodged conflicts before ultimately settling in the United States as refugees.\n RELATED: Boston Bomb Suspect Alarmed Russian Relatives With Extremist Views\n The father's side of the family is ethnic Chechen, but they were among the many Chechen families who were expelled from the region by Stalin in February 1944 when he considered Chechens to be disloyal during World War II. They resettled in Kyrgyzstan, which then was part of the Soviet Union. It was there that the suspects' father, Anzor Tsarnaev, was born and raised.\n He served his mandatory military term in the early 1980s in Novosibirsk, where he met his wife, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva. Her family was from Dagestan but she was in Novosibirsk to visit a relative.\n The two married and eventually returned to live in Kyrgyzstan. They had four children, two girls and two boys, the two suspects.

They only lived there for about six months before obtaining refugee status and resettling in the United States.\n The aunt said the parents would come back to Dagestan to visit from time to time, but the sons stayed in the United States.\n Tamerlan, the older son who died in a gun battle with police Friday, visited for the first time last year. His six-month stay has raised eyebrows among investigators looking into how and why he is suspected of becoming radicalized. Dzhokhar, the younger son who was taken alive Friday, was planning to visit Dagestan for the first time in May, the aunt said.\n The parents bought an apartment in Makhachkala, the Dagestani capital, with the hopes that their children would stay there whenever they visited.\n RELATED: Bombing Suspects' Mom: 'My Family Is in the Dirt'\n The mother, in a separate interview with ABC News, revealed that she and her husband divorced in the United States several years ago because the husband did not agree with her stricter embrace of Islamic traditions. The couple reconciled, she said, after they both moved to Dagestan and have been brought closer by their grief this week.\n A few years ago -- the aunt did not recall exactly when -- the father was severely beaten by what she described as a group of Russian athletes as he tried to defend another person from them. The beating left him with medical problems that did not improve with treatment in the United States.\n Eventually, with his health failing and having lost a significant amount of weight, the father decided to come back to Dagestan in May 2012. Tamerlan, his oldest son, had just arrived there a couple months earlier.\n Anzor Tsarnaev decided to pursue medical treatment, figuring that if he died, he would at least be buried here. The mother also moved in Dagestan a few months later because she was feeling homesick.\n During his six-month stay in Dagestan, Tamerlan made several trips to Chechnya to visit relatives along with his father, his aunt said.

Photo: AFP\nFired by a potent mix of blood codes, separatist yearnings and Islamic militancy, Chechen groups have staged a string of intermittent but spectacular attacks in Moscow and elsewhere in Russia since the 1990s. They have bombed trains, planes and subways, attacked a rock concert and slammed a truck bomb into a hospital. In 2002, they seized a crowded theater in Moscow, an attack that culminated in a commando raid that killed 130 hostages.\n Advertisement\nIn the spring of 2004, a bomb placed in a stadium in Grozny, the regional capital, killed the Kremlin's hand-picked Chechen president. That summer, female suicide bombers with hand grenades brought down two Russian passenger jets nearly simultaneously, killing 90 people.\nDays later, a group of terrorists working for Shamil Basayev, the one-legged separatist military commander who was then Russia's most wanted man, stormed a public school in the small town of Beslan, in a nearby republic, leading to the deaths of more than 300 people, most of them schoolchildren, their parents and their teachers.\nA video grab from NTV Russian television shows security personnel helping a man believed to be the late Chechen president Akhmad Kadyrov, seconds after an explosion at a stadium in Grozny, May 9, 2004. Photo: Reuters\nSuch violence had typically been confined within Russia.\nReports, often based on little more than rumors or Kremlin-sourced leaks, of extensive Chechen involvement in terrorism or insurgencies elsewhere have been a staple of public commentary on such violence since 2001.\nThese reports \u2014 of Chechen snipers and bomb-makers appearing in one conflict after another, and of Chechens filling the ranks of armed groups in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere \u2014 often proved to be exaggerated.\nPresident of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov. Photo: Reuters\nChechnya's battles with Russia and against Russian rule had been fought in recurring if irregular cycles for centuries; Chechens did not have to travel to find their foes, much less their targets. In interviews many Chechen emigrants and fighters have emphasized that they consider their enemies to be local, not foreign.\nBut in time outside influences crept into the North Caucasus' homegrown war, and the moves and countermoves between Russians and Chechens spread beyond Russia's borders.\nTwo wars erupted between Russia and Chechen separatists in the 1990s. The first had old roots. Many Chechens, an independent Muslim people of the highlands, have long chafed at what they view as Russia's imperial rule. With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the breakup of the Warsaw Pact, Chechen separatists perceived a fresh chance to claim their own state.\nAt least 322 people, including 155 children, died during a bloody end to a hostage-taking at a school in the southern Russian town of Beslan, near Chechnya. Photo: Reuters\nChechnya's oil reserves provided an incentive for both sides to refuse to yield their claims, and Islam colored the fight. Arab fighters appeared in Chechnya with the onset of the first war, saying they had come to help fellow Muslims fight oppression.\nBy the mid- and late-1990s, several training camps operated almost openly in rural Chechnya, led in part by a foreign jihadi, Ibn al-Khattab.\nLater, however, many Chechens said the Arab influence had declined amid tensions between the Sufi Chechens and Sunni Arabs, who typically adhere to different Islamic traditions and practices. In addition, the allure of the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan, Chechens say, drew many Arab fighters away from Chechnya's mountains.\nAnd yet the ripple effects of the Chechen wars eventually played out in 2004 in the Arab emirate of Qatar, where Russian agents assassinated an exiled Chechen leader with a car bomb, and on the streets of Vienna in 2009 when Chechens gunned down a fellow Chechen who had broken from the Kremlin-supported leadership in the republic to file a complaint in the European Court of Human Rights. The complaint detailed torture by the Russian-backed security services, and the republic's current president, Ramzan A. Kadyrov.\nJust a week ago, the United States put Kadyrov, a former rebel turned ally of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and the primary subject of the torture complaint, on a secret list of Russian citizens banned from the United States for human rights abuses, according to people briefed on the list.\nCuriously, the most political of the video clips posted on social media by one of the Tsarnaev brothers was not aimed at the West, but at Kadyrov, who is loathed by many Chechens and regarded as a vicious Kremlin stooge.\nKadyrov on Friday dismissed the Tsarnaev brothers and any ties between the Boston bombing and Chechnya. \"The roots of this evil are to be found in America,\" he said in a post on Instagram.\nWith all its long-standing crosscurrents, and partly because of its seeming remoteness and small scale, the Chechen conflict has long confounded American leaders and policymakers.\nBoris Yeltsin, president of Russia immediately after the Soviet breakup, launched a war from 1994 to 1996 to re-establish control of the region. As Yeltsin's prime minister, Putin ordered a second war in 1999, after a brief period of Chechen self-rule that was characterized by criminality and accusations of terrorism.\nPutin waged a relentless campaign that included carpet bombing and the indiscriminate shelling of Grozny, with more ordnance than any European city had endured since World War II.\nWhile the United States has shared intelligence on Chechen militants with the Russian government over the years, American officials have been reluctant to be too associated with Moscow's Chechnya policies, which resulted in the destruction of Grozny, the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians and the indiscriminate imprisonment of many young men. Then, as open resistance declined, control was maintained by flagrantly rigged elections and collective punishment.\nAt one point during President George W. Bush's administration, a debate broke out over a proposal by a National Security Council official to effectively partner with the Russians in fighting Chechen rebels. Other officials from the State Department and Pentagon vociferously opposed it, arguing that the United States should not ally itself with the Kremlin's tactics.\nBy then what had started as a separatist revolt had partially assumed a jihadi cast. The Chechen cause had been adopted by the likes of Osama bin Laden and other foreign radicals, who tried to insinuate themselves into the struggle; several Chechen rebel leaders embraced Islam as a rallying cry.\nBin Laden's top deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, had traveled to Russia in 1996 to explore the possibility of relocating operations to Chechnya and was arrested on a visa violation, only to be released several months later. Mohammed Atta, a future Sept. 11 hijacker, and other members of an al-Qaida cell initially wanted to join the jihad in Chechnya but were told it was too hard to get in and were advised to go to Afghanistan instead.\nWith the defection of some rebels like Kadyrov and his father, Moscow eventually re-established control over most of Chechnya. Much of Grozny was rebuilt.\nBut the separatist insurgency has never been extinguished. Whether the Boston bombing was tied to it is still unclear, but a generation of young Chechen men have never known a peaceful homeland, coming of age as young Muslims with few prospects at home in the Caucasus, and difficulties finding a place abroad.\nNew York Times", "date": "Sun, 21 Apr 2013 00:00:00 GMT", "id": "4029"}, {"title": "Dzhokhar Tsarnaev charged with conspiring to use WMD, may face death penalty \u2014 RT USA", "url": "http://rt.com/usa/suspect-awake-charges-questioning-210/", "author": "-", "content": "Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the surviving brother implicated in the deadly Boston Marathon bombings, has been charged with using weapons of mass destruction to kill people, a federal crime which is punishable by death, the Justice Department said.\nFollow RT\u2019s day-by-day timeline on Boston Marathon bombings\nThe Justice Department said on Monday that 19-year-old Dzokhar Tsarnaev had been charged with one count of using a weapon of mass destruction and one count of malicious destruction of property resulting in death.\nThe charges are punishable by death, life in prison, or any other indeterminate prison sentence, the department said in a statement.\nAccording to the affidavit of Special Agent Daniel R.

He further said the neck wounds Tsarnaev sustained may have been self-inflicted, based on the positioning of the entry wound and exit wound.\nAccording to the unsealed indictment, Tsarnaev further suffered gunshot wounds to the head, legs and hand.\n The High-Value Detainee Interrogation Group - a multi-security agency unit tasked with interrogating high-value suspects \u2013 had previously been unable to question Tsarnaev following his capture on Friday night due to the extent of his injuries. A primary goal of investigators is to determine if the brothers acted alone and whether there are any unexploded bombs yet to be accounted for.\n Previously, Boston Mayor Thomas Menino expressed his doubts the brothers were part of a larger terror network.\n\u201cAll of the information that I have, they acted alone, these two individuals, the brothers,\u201d he said on ABC News\u2019s \u2018This Week\u2019.\n Menino had also stated that due the extent of Dzhokhar\u2019s injuries, \u201cwe don't know if we'll ever be able to question the individual.\"\n Ruslan Tsarni, an uncle of the accused and his late brother and co-suspect Tamerlan, told the Associated Press that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had been \u201cused\u201d by his older brother to carry out the bombing. \"He's not been understanding anything,\" Tsarni said. \"He's a 19-year-old boy.\"\n\u2018Mama, I love you\u2019\n Meanwhile, Anzor Tsarnaev, the father of the two suspected Boston bombers, is set to travel from Russia to the United States to seek \u201cjustice and truth.\u201d\n Tsarnaev told AP that he had \"lots of questions for the police\" and he wants \"to clear up many things.\"\n Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, the suspects\u2019 mother, said her husband plans to travel on Wednesday, adding that their family would try to bring the body of their elder son back to Russia.\n Speaking with ABC News, Tsarnaeva recounted her final conversation with her slain 26-year-old son Tamerlan Tsarnaev, which occurred just moments before a deadly standoff with police in the streets of Watertown, Massachusetts, early Friday morning.\n\"The police, they have started shooting at us, they are chasing us,\" Tsarnaeva recalled her son as telling her.\nHe said \"Mama, I love you \u201d as his mother became frightened and begin to sob and shout. Just as the line cut off, Tamerlan Tsarnaev apparently told his mother that his younger brother was with him.\nHer daughter later called her to tell her that Tamerlan Tsarnaev had been killed.\nOn Monday, Tsarnaev's widow said she learned about her husband\u2019s alleged role in the Boston Marathon bombing by watching TV, the New York Daily News reports.\n After federal investigators visited Katherine Russell Tsarnaev at her parents\u2019 home in Rhode Island, her attorney said he had spoken with authorities and is currently \u201cdeciding what we want to do and how we want to approach this.\u201d\nDetails of the fatal standoff emerged on Sunday, beginning on Thursday night when the brothers allegedly ambushed and killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer, then hijacking a Mercedes-Benz SUV\n The carjack victim, who asked not to be identified, told police that his life was spared because \u201che wasn\u2019t American,\u201d NBC news reports. According to the criminal complaint, one bomber asked the carjacking victim if he had heard about Monday\u2019s bombings, saying \u201cI did that.\u201d Police believe the pair might have been headed to New York.\n For some time the elder brother drove the carjacked vehicle while the younger brother drove his own Honda. After forcing the victim to withdraw $800 dollars from an ATM, he was later able to escape while the brothers stopped in a convenience store. Police used the victim\u2019s cellphone to track the car, Watertown Police Chief Edward Deveau told ABC.\nThe fierce shootout erupted when the pair was spotted by a Watertown cop, who was told not to approach the suspects until backup arrived.\n\"Unfortunately, they brought their fight to us. They stopped their car because they knew he was behind them. And immediately started shooting at my police officer,\" Deveau said.\nDeveau said they were still attempting to determine the extent of the arsenal used by the brothers.\n\u201cMy understanding is that there were firearms and there was a long rifle,\" he said.\n\"Our other officers were responding immediately. They were seconds behind him. So immediately we had three or four Watertown police officers in a gun fight with these two brothers,\" Deveau continued.\n\"At some point they go behind the Honda, open the trunk and start heaving a device at our officers. And there was a huge explosion. We believe that was the pressure cooker bomb that went off. We found the pressure cooker lid embedded into a car further down the street,\" he said.\nThe unsealed indictment also revealed that a 3rd pressure cooker improvised explosive device (IED) was discovered by the FBI in an abandoned car.\nBoston Police Commissioner Edward Davis told CBS's Face the Nation on Sunday that another attack was imminent.\n\"We have reason to believe, based upon the evidence that was found at that scene - the explosions, the explosive ordinance that was unexploded and the firepower that they had - that they were going to attack other individuals,\" he said.\n\"That's my personal belief at this time,\" Davis continued.\nHe said that more than 250 spent rounds of ammunition were found at the scene, and that the ground was \"littered with unexploded improvised explosive devices that we had to point out to the arriving officers.\" Tamerlan Tsarnaev, reportedly got within three meters of police officers before he ran out of ammunition and was tackled. He later died from wounds sustained in the shootout.\nHis injured younger brother Dzhokhar Tsarnaev fled the scene, forcing officers to conduct a house to house search in Watertown.

(Image credit: AFP/Getty Images via @daylife)\nPundits tut-tutted when a left-wing publication (see Salon.com) hoped out loud that white, anti-tax, domestic terrorists perpetrated the Boston marathon massacre. They had reason to hope: Wouldn\u2019t backwoods, pick-up-truck radicals pick tax day for their strike?  What a disappointment to learn that the terrorists were young Muslim devotees of extremist web sites.\nSuch a liberal Wunschtraum was indeed in bad taste, but terror incidents do have political consequences, sometimes vast; so why shy away from discussing them?\nThe Oklahoma City bombing by white anti-government terrorists resuscitated a faltering Clinton presidency. George Bush\u2019s performance at the ruins of the World Trade Center in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 was the high point of his presidency.\nBoston extremism should plague Barack Obama throughout his second term as it raises legitimate question about his handling of the war on terror. It will help Vladimir Putin remove the last vestiges of democracy and free press from his totalitarian Russia without a peep from the U.S.\nThe Boston Marathon attack undermines Obama\u2019s claimed foreign-policy achievement (\u201cI killed Osama and Al Qaeda is on the run.\u201d) on which he based his campaign. A newsman as respected as Tom Brokaw refuted Obama in clear words (on Meet the Press) that could not be misunderstood: \u201cWith the death of Osama Bin Laden, Islamic rage did not go away. In fact, it is in some ways more dangerous.\u201d\nImagine the effect of a Brokaw making such a statement on the eve of the election, but Obama no longer has to face the electorate. He is home safe.\nAt a more fundamental level, Boston extremism calls into question Obama\u2019s treatment of Islamic extremism with excessive sensitivity, sympathy, and understanding. If we can understand the root causes of Islamic terror and recognize our own fault in the matter, we can them win over, Obama appears to believe. We must be slow to blame and not offend Muslim sensitivities. A Muslim-American army psychiatrist who shoots fellow soldiers with the cry \u201cAllah is great\u201d must have been mistreated or suffer from mental problems. His ties with a radical Muslim preacher are just coincidence. The Obama administration asked us to believe that the fatal attack on our Benghazi consulate was by an unorganized mob enraged by an anti-Islam film. Also we must not mistreat suspected Islamic terrorists once in custody as did his insensitive predecessor (but we can kill them with drone strikes from the air).\nBoston extremism raises entirely legitimate questions about the Obama administration\u2019s handling of the war on terror.  Over the past four years, tales of plots and conspiracies thwarted by an almost infallible security team lulled us into a sense of security. Boston suggests this was either exaggeration or simply good luck.\nVladimir Putin is an entirely different story. He gets a windfall from Boston extremism. When President Obama telephoned Putin to thank him for his cooperation, it should have been Putin thanking Obama for boosting him both at home and abroad.\nPutin wants to use the Boston massacre to suggest to America and the rest of the world that it is he, Putin, who vigilantly guards the front line against Islamic terrorism in Chechnya. He would like to use the Chechen brothers\u2019 killing of innocent people in Boston to show what he is up against in the North Caucasus and why his troops and proxies have, at times, gone over the line of torture, murder, and bombing of civilians. (Estimates place Chechen civilian casualties between 50,000 and 200,000 in a population of 1.2 million).\nThe Chechen origin of the Boston bombers gives Putin a freer hand to deal brutally and mercilessly with opponents/terrorists in Chechnya and move against the few human rights advocates left in Russia willing to take up the cause of atrocities on Chechen civilians.\nThe timing of the Boston marathon slaughter also could not have been more propitious for Putin. Over Obama\u2019s objections, Congress\u2019s just released its \u201cMagnitsky List\u201d of Russian human-rights abusers denied U.S. visas. Three officials on the list were charged with atrocities in Chechnya.\nI would imagine that Putin may have wanted to vent to Obama more during their phone conversation. He has publicly suggested that Obama deep-six the Magnitsky List and has opined that Western journalists stop complaining about the unsolved murder of investigative reporter Anna Politovskaya.\nMost of all, Putin wants the world to view Chechnya as part of the war against Islamic terror, not as the brutal suppression of an independence movement that has legitimate grievances. He does not want outsiders to know that Chechen nationalists fight for national independence, not against Christian crusaders or for a new caliphate.\nChechnya did not become interested in independence just recently. Chechens used their mountainous terrain and fierce warriors to remain free of the Tartar Yoke from the thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries and was the last independent region incorporated into the Russian Empire . Chechens paid a stiff price for their nationalism in the Soviet period. From the late 1930s through World War II, Stalin deported Chechens as traitors to Soviet power.\nAs in Syria, the Chechen picture is a mixed one. The invasion of a Muslim republic by \u201cChristian\u201d Russian forces naturally attracted extremists to Chechnya (and has provided international extremism with warriors, now including the Tsarnaev brothers).\nWhile Putin fights an independence movement, which he wants us to interpret as a war against Islamic terrorism, the United States battles the fundamentalist Islam of Al Qaeda, and its numerous branches, offshoots, and copycats. Putin has shown a lack of interested in joining the general fight against Islamic extremism. He just wants the world to give him a free hand \u2013 under the pretext that he is fighting against Muslim terrorists \u2014 to complete his destruction of the Chechen independence movement.\nPutin is the anti-Obama with respect to his brutal treatment of Chechen Muslims: In his first days in power, Putin publicly blamed Chechen terrorists for bombing civilian apartment houses even though evidence pointed to his own security forces. Putin\u2019s scorched earth attack left a Chechnya of ghost cities and towns and tens of thousands of Chechen civilians dead. Journalists investigating horrible atrocities against Chechen civilians were taken out by professional killers, who remain unpunished. Putin did not restrain his skin-head Nashi hooligans, when they targeted dark skinned people on the streets. Putin has made the cooperative Russian Orthodox Church the state religion, leaving little room for Russia\u2019s massive Muslim population.\nWe are in the early stages of understanding what happened in Boston. We will surely find out because the mayhem and carnage of Boston played out in full view of a world that will demand answers. The Chechen link has given Putin a prize that he will exploit to the last drop. Obama, on the other hand, must rebut the charges that will surely come that his war on terror has not been the success he claimed it was.", "date": "Mon, 18 Jun 2012 00:00:00 GMT", "id": "5467"}, {"title": "Boston Marathon bombing suspects' sister holed up in West New York, New Jersey home", "url": "http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/national_world&id=9072306", "author": "-", "content": "WEST NEW YORK, New Jersey --  A sister of the Boston Marathon bombing suspects was holed up in her northern New Jersey home on Saturday, as she worked through her grief and considered addressing the allegations against her brothers.\n Police continued to stand guard at the West New York apartment building where Ailina Tsarnaeva lives with her husband and baby, and authorities say officers will remain at the site indefinitely for her protection.\n West New York Police Director Michael Indri spoke briefly with Tsarnaeva inside her apartment Saturday.

Dzhokar Tsarnaev was captured on April 19 after a day-long manhunt and a confrontation with police in which his brother, Tamerlan, was killed.\nThe family\u2019s ancestral home is in Chechnya, and Tamerlan visited relatives there in 2012 during a half-year stay in Russia spent mostly in the neighboring republic of Dagestan, an aunt, Patimat Suleimanova, told reporters. An uncle, Ruslan Tsarni, also told reporters they were ethnic Chechens.\nWhile Chechen separatists and their supporters have taken credit for several terrorist attacks in recent years, none took place outside the borders of Russia. An attack in the U.S. would be a first, according to Christopher Swift, a professor of national security studies at Georgetown University in Washington who has studied the insurgency.\n\u201cThat is a big deal,\u201d Swift said in an April 19 interview. \u201cThey haven\u2019t attacked U.S. targets before because they\u2019ve always been focused on Russia and gaining independence from Russia. To the extent they\u2019ve ever cared about the United States, it\u2019s been rhetorical and ideological, but never operational. This would change that.\u201d\nMotivation Unclear\nIt isn\u2019t yet clear what motivated the Tsarnaev brothers. Tamerlan spent most of his six months in Dagestan reading the Koran, according to his aunt, and the FBI said in a statement that he was brought to its attention two years ago by a foreign government concerned that he held extremist Islamic beliefs. A U.S. law enforcement official identified the government as Russia.\nYet the FBI said it had found no evidence at that time of Tamerlan engaging in terrorist activity, and his uncle said he believed the brothers\u2019 actions had \u201cnothing to do with Chechnya.\u201d An Islamic rebel group based in the Northern Caucasus denied any link to the Boston bombings and said its fight was directed against Russia, not the U.S.\nAlvi Karimov, a spokesman for Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov, said last week the brothers \u201cweren\u2019t born, raised, taught or somehow shaped in the Chechen republic\u201d and that the roots of their actions were to be found \u201cin the place they rose and studied -- in the U.S.\u201d\nConflict\u2019s Origins\nThe Chechen conflict began almost two decades ago as an attempt by the majority Muslim republic to break away from Moscow\u2019s control in the backwash of the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse. The rebellion veered in an Islamic-extremist direction when Russian troops returned to Chechnya after a brief hiatus in 1999.\n\u201cIt started as a Chechen nationalist movement, and as the second Chechen war dragged on, it became a radical Salafist movement,\u201d said Swift, referring to an ultra-orthodox form of Islam. \u201cThey were democratic Islamists at the beginning, but the second Chechen War radicalized the rebel movement in profound and disturbing ways. They came to adopt the ideology of the global jihad movement.\u201d\nThe originally secular movement shifted toward Islamic radicalism when its leaders saw that as a path to support from the Muslim world in the form of money and fighters, said Svante Cornell, a researcher at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s School of Advanced International Studies in Washington who has studied the Caucasus and Central Asia.\n\u2018Be Cool\u2019\n\u201cThat some young Chechnyans who were initially motivated by local concerns got sucked up in global issues that have nothing to do with the original concerns makes a lot of sense,\u201d Cornell said in a phone interview. \u201cYou know how people who are trying to be cool in the West wear a Che Guevara T-shirt? To be cool in Chechnya, you wear a Bin Laden T-shirt.\u201d\nThe conflict began in December 1994 when Russian army forces entered the republic to suppress a bid by its political leaders for independence. After an uneasy truce from 1996 to 1999, it flared again when then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops back into Chechnya following a string of bombings in Russian cities that Putin attributed to Chechens.\nEstimates of those killed and exiled in the conflict have varied widely. A 2010 background report on Chechnya by the Council on Foreign Relations concluded that \u201ctens of thousands of Chechens and Russians were killed or wounded in the two wars, and hundreds of thousands of civilians were displaced.\u201d\nCapital Destroyed\nThe Chechen capital of Grozny was devastated by fighting in 1994-95 and again in the conflict that started in 1999. Russian forces seeking to dislodge separatists from the city in 1995 used long-range bombing and shelling to attack rebel strongholds, often leveling surrounding structures as residents cowered in basements.\nThe U.S. government has accepted the principle of Russian sovereignty over Chechnya and the rest of the Northern Caucasus while criticizing what it says are human rights abuses committed by Russia and its local partners in suppressing the separatists.\nIn its annual human rights report for 2012, issued last week, for example, the State Department said cited reports from Russian human rights groups that security forces in both Chechnya and Dagestan were guilty of abducting suspected rebels, using indiscriminate force to detain people and torturing those arrested.\nRebel Switched\nThe republic has been relatively quiescent in recent years after Kadyrov, once a rebel, switched sides and brutally asserted control over Chechnya with Russian support. Kadyrov\u2019s father, Akhmad, who was assassinated in 2004, began the process of pacifying Chechnya.\nAt the same time, some separatists turned to terrorism. An attack by militants on a school in Beslan, North Ossetia, another republic in the Northern Caucasus, in September 2004 left 350 people dead, half of them children.\nChechen insurgents also carried out an attack on Moscow\u2019s Dubrovka Theater in October 2002, a hostage-taking that resulted in 130 fatalities when Russian forces attempted a rescue operation.\nA suicide bombing at Moscow\u2019s Domodedovo Airport, the busiest air hub in Russia, killed at least 37 people in January 2011. A year earlier, twin suicide subway bombings during the morning rush hour in the Moscow subway killed 40 people.\nChechen militant leader Doku Umarov claimed responsibility for both the Domodedovo attack and the subway bombings. Russian authorities have linked Umarov to a foiled plot to attack the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics, which they say they uncovered last year.\nPutin, who was elected president of Russia in 2000 in part on the popularity he gained from unleashing the second Chechen war, vowed last year to combat Islamic extremists.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Ken Fireman in Washington at kfireman1@bloomberg.net Henry Meyer in Moscow at hmeyer4@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Cesca Antonelli in Washington at fantonelli@bloomberg.net\n Enlarge image\nDzhokar Tsarnaev, one of the suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing, is shown in an undated handout photo provided by the FBI to the media on Friday, April 19, 2013.

Anzor Tsarnaev, their father\u2014who claims to have spoken with one of his sons the day after the Marathon attacks\u2014lives in Makhachkala, Dagestan, a small region of the Russian Federation that borders Chechnya on the Black Sea. The father has said that his elder son, Tamerlan, now dead, visited \u201crelatives\u201d in Chechnya last year. (U.S. officials report that Tamerlan flew to Moscow in January, 2012, and returned to the U.S. six months later.)\nThe young men\u2019s father is said to be an ethnic Chechen, but born and raised in Kyrgyzstan\u2014a former Soviet republic in Central Asia. (On Red Army Day in the winter of 1944, Stalin deported hundreds of thousands Chechens from their homeland\u2014many died, but many who survived the journey resettled in Central Asia.) The Tsarnaevs' mother, who does not have a traditional Chechen first name, is said to be from Dagestan. Tamerlan, the older brother, was reportedly born in Dagestan, while his younger brother, Dzhokhar, was born in 1993\u2014in Kyrgyzstan. So it would seem\u2014at this early point\u2014that their ties to Chechnya were tenuous. It remains to be seen, if in fact Tamerlan Tsarnaev visited Chechnya last year, what he did during his time there.\n The suspects' family responds to the hunt for the two young men.\nHow big is the Chechen community in this country?\nExtremely small. There\u2019s no official organization, no association, or even an online community, of ethnic Chechens living in the US. It cannot even be termed a \u201cDiaspora\u201d\u2014I\u2019d estimate the total at no more than 250 people. One Chechen refugee in New York tries to keep track of every Chechen in the country the refugee has met\u2014the list runs to 81 people. They\u2019re spread out across the country\u2014New York, Miami, Washington, D.C., New Jersey, California, and Boston.\nEuropean nations have taken far greater numbers of refugees from Chechnya. In Austria, the Czech Republic, France, Belgium, and Germany, for instance, the number of formerly Chechen nationals ranges in the thousands, if not tens of thousands. Turkey, a country close to Chechnya, and with traditional and ethnic ties, may have the largest population: with an estimated 50,000 ethnic Chechens.\nWhy have they left their homeland?\nWar. Chechnya\u2014a tiny region in the Caucasus that\u2019s about the size of Connecticut\u2014has suffered two wars in recent years. From 1994-96, in the \u201cfirst\u201d war, a charismatic (if unhinged) former Soviet air force general named Dzhokhar Dudaev sought to free his people from the Kremlin\u2019s control and create a would-be statelet. Then in the fall of 1999, the \u201csecond\u201d Chechen war began\u2014dubbed Putin\u2019s War, after the newcomer in the Kremlin, then all but unknown in the West: Vladimir Putin. Though the true death toll will never be known, human rights experts estimate the total dead\u2014of Russians and ethnic Chechens\u2014in the hundreds of thousands.\nBut one point bears remembering: if in the first war, the Chechen rebels were \u201cfreedom fighters\u201d in the old Ronald Reagan/Margaret Thatcher way of seeing things, young men hungering for independence in a guerrilla war of decolonization, Putin\u2019s War marked a sharp turn. Beginning in the fall of 1999, the Russian assault was far more brutal (more troops, even more bombs), and the Chechen response further radicalized. The talk soon turned from sovereignty to revenge, and among the young, and most militant, fighters, those with the least experience of the Soviet yoke, the rebellion carried a new name: jihad.\nAslan Akhmatov/AP\nThe talk soon turned from sovereignty to revenge, and among the young, and most militant, fighters, those with the least experience of the Soviet yoke, the rebellion carried a new name: jihad.\nRuslan Tsarni, a man claiming to be an uncle of the Tsarnaev brothers, has said that they received \u201casylum\u201d in 2003. How common is that?\nVery rare. First, it is unclear if the uncle meant \u201cpolitical asylum,\u201d or if he knows the legal status of their residency in this country. But if that claim proves true, it would seem an exception. Only a few ethnic Chechens\u2014the precise number is not known\u2014are here because they have succeeded in winning political asylum. Ilyas Ahkmadov, the former Foreign Minister (1999-2005), who fought during the first Chechen-Russian war, lives in the U.S. But even with the backing of some of Washington\u2019s most prominent politicians, Akhmadov has had to wage a long and arduous campaign to stay.\nSome of the \u201cChechens\u201d in this country are even second\u2014and third-generation Americans\u2014families whose roots lie in Jordan, among the Chechen Diaspora there, which formed largely after Stalin\u2019s mass deportation of the Chechens.\nIn the aftermath of \"Putin's War\", with Moscow again firmly in control in Chechnya, have Chechen fighters turned increasingly to terrorism?\nAgain let's be clear: It remains to be established that the Tsarnaev brothers had any strong link to Chechnya\u2014either its recent history of warfare, or to the terrorists, both native and foreign, who have sought to wage jihad in the name of Chechen independence.\nThe brothers, though, had fled a region long wracked by violence. Whether in Makhachkala or Boston, they were likely to have known its toll.\nSince 2000, Russians and Chechens have seen a succession of deadly terrorist attacks arising from the wars in the Caucasus. In June 2000, Khava Barayeva, a relative of two Chechen field commanders, blew herself up in a truck bomb at a military checkpoint in Chechnya\u2014becoming the world's first known Chechen female suicide bomber. In May 2002, a bomb at Victory Day parade in Dagestan (where the Tsarnaevs' parents are reported to live now) killed 35 people, including 12 children. That fall came the Moscow theater siege\u2014when 41 terrorists, including 18 women, seized a Moscow theater, holding almost 800 people hostage for three days. In the end, Russian Special Forces stormed the theater, killing all the terrorists and 130 hostages. (The hostages were killed by the gas the Russians deployed.)\nThe string of attacks that has followed is seemingly without end. But none looms larger in Russians\u2019 memory than the siege in Beslan. On September 1, 2004, the first day of school, a group of terrorists\u2014among them Chechens, Ingush (a neighboring ethnic group of the North Caucasus) and at least one ethnic Slav\u2014took nearly 1,200 civilians hostage in a middle school in Beslan, North Ossetia\u2014a region in Russia to the west of Chechnya. By the siege\u2019s end, an estimated 1,000 civilians were killed or wounded\u2014hundreds of them children. Putin leveled the blame at the \"intervention of international terrorists.\" But Aslan Maskhadov, the former rebel leader, and once a sober-minded negotiator with the Kremlin, spoke out from hiding to denounce the attack. The Beslan operation, Maskhadov said, was the work of \"madmen\" driven by revenge, not insurgents fighting for freedom for their homeland.\nIn the years since Beslan, few Russians speak of \"Chechen rebels\" any more, but rather of \"Chechen terrorists.\" And the long-suffering Chechens who remain in their homeland have seen it return to the Russian fold. Its capital, Grozny, once leveled to ruins that resembled Stalingrad in World War II, is now rebuilt, with gleaming banks and towering apartment buildings. But Chechnya has become a republic of fear, the fiefdom of one man: its mercurial 36-year-old president, Ramzan Kadyrov.", "date": "Fri, 19 Apr 2013 18:34:16 GMT", "id": "3180"}, {"title": "Liberal Columnist Cautions: Too Soon to Say Islamic Extremism Motivated Tsarnaev Brothers", "url": "http://newsbusters.org/blogs/howard-portnoy/2013/04/21/liberal-columnist-cautions-too-soon-say-islamic-extremism-motivated-", "author": "Howard Portnoy", "content": "In a column published Friday, Megan Garber, a staff writer at \u201cThe Atlantic\u201d proffers some sage advice to members of the media: Stop pinning labels on people whose names end up in the headlines because of dastardly deeds. The title of piece \u2014 \u201cThe Boston Bombers Were Muslim: So?\u201d \u2014 is meant as an admonition. And so are the opening paragraphs, which catalog all the things \u201cwe think we\u201d know about the brothers Tsarnaev (Tamerlan was a \u201cgifted athlete\u201d and \u201cvery religious,\u201d Dzhokar is \u201cvery quiet\u201d and career-oriented).\n Although some of the descriptors she cites are well-documented (for example, \u201cDzhokar received a scholarship from the City of Cambridge\u201d), she dismisses all in the third paragraph as \u201cprovisional facts,\u201d adding:\n They are the products of the chaos of breaking news, and may well also be the products of people who stretch the truth \u2014 or break it \u2014 in order to play a role in the mayhem. They are very much subject to change. But they are also reminders of something it\u2019s so easy to forget right now, especially for the many, many members of the media \u2014 professional and otherwise \u2014 who currently find themselves under pressure of live air or deadline: Tamerlan and Dzhokar Tsarnaev are not simply \u2018the Marathon bombers,\u2019 or \u2018murderers,\u2019 or \u2018Chechens,\u2019 or \u2018immigrants,\u2019 or \u2018Muslims.\u2019 They might turn out to be all of those things. They might not. The one thing we know for sure is that they are not only those things. They had friends and families and lives. They had YouTube accounts and Twitter feeds. They went to class. They went to work. They came home, and they left it again.\n Well, shucks, don\u2019t we all feel like a bunch of jerks now?\n Putting aside the smarmy and misplaced sympathy, there is actually a kernel of truth to Garber\u2019s cracker barrel psychologizing. So far no definitive link has been established between the Tsarnaevs\u2019 religious beliefs and their deadly actions last Monday. But similar claims may be made for every other news story centering on extreme violence. Yet, that reality has not deterred writers who share Garber\u2019s leftist persuasion from applying labels with alacrity, so long as the \u201cvillain\u201d is a white male (or even when he is not: George Zimmerman anyone?).\n To take a recent example, right after the Newtown shootings, liberal commentators resorted not only to labels but stereotypes. David Sirota, who recently enshrined himself in the pantheon of leftist bigotry by expressing his fervent hope that the Marathon bombers would turn out to be white males, appeared on MSNBC last December to offer support for the systematic profiling of white males.\n The publication Garber writes for has been guilty of wholesale labeling, as evidenced by an article that appeared at the publication\u2019s blog, The Atlantic Wire, in the wake of the Tuscon shootings.\n One could argue in Garber\u2019s defense that her column is intended as a \u201cwarning to both benches.\u201d But she tramples on that rationale by ignoring her own advice, writing:\n The problem is that there is no real place for the Boston bombings and their aftermath, just as there was no real place for Aurora or Columbine or Newtown. Their events were, in a very literal sense, outliers: They are (in the U.S., at least) out of the ordinary. They were the products of highly unusual sets of circumstances \u2014 of complexity, rather than contradictions. [Emphasis added]\n She has decided in advance of any known motive for the bombings that they were the product of lone wolves. This assumption stands in blunt contradiction to her own admissions elsewhere that the Tsarnaevs\u2019 Islamic faith may have \u201cmotivated them in their actions on Monday.\u201d", "date": "Sun, 21 Apr 2013 00:00:00 GMT", "id": "2943"}, {"title": "Photo of Boston cop\u2019s act of kindness goes viral", "url": "http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/lookout/boston-police-milk-watertown-photo-124528069.html", "author": "Dylan Stableford", "content": "Police Officer John Bradley (Kevin Wells/Facebook)\nDuring Friday's intense manhunt for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in Watertown, Mass., when the city of Boston was on lockdown, a Brookline police officer delivered milk to a family with a baby.\nAnd like many random acts of kindness seen in the wake the marathon bombings, the photo\u2014posted to Facebook by the family\u2014went viral, thanks in part to a tweet from the Boston Police Department:\nBPD Officer delivers milk to a family with young children in Watertown during the lockdown.\nKevin Wells, the father, took the photo of the officer, John Bradley, as he arrived carrying two gallons of milk for Holden, Wells' 17-month-old son.\nDuring the lockdown, the boy's grandmother, who was visiting from Colorado, left the house to ask the officer if he could grab some milk for the young couple.\n\u201cIt just meant the world that he literally went out and got two gallons of milk,\" McKenzie Wells, the boy's mother, told Today.com. \u201cWe wanted to pay him, but he wouldn\u2019t take money from us.
